    This page controls the colors of each sector. <br>
    Use the wheel to select which sector to choose a color for, then use the color picker to update that color in realtime. <br>
    <b>Maybe? The spectrum cycle checkbox will cycle between all available colors smoothly, but color picking will be disabled in this mode.</b>
