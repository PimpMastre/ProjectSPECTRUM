    This setting controls the previous peaks buffers. The buffer is used to normalize the output data of the audio analyzer, averaging the new values with the previously calculated n sets of peaks, where n is the buffer's length.<br>
    This buffer is also used to control the new peak's velocity, using only the last value in the buffer to calculate the new travel distance.
